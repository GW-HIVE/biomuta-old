Step 2: Convert
===============

For each resource, a unique script is used to convert from the raw format provided by the resource, to a format aligned with past versions of the Biomuta pipeline.

With a common format, all resources can then be combined into a master dataset.

See the individual resource pages for details on the conversion:

.. toctree::
    tcga_convert
    civic_convert
    cosmic_convert
    icgc_convert
