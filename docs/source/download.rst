========================

The download step is the first step of the Biomuta pipeline. Files containing mutations are gethered directly from the four resouces:

    - **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** : https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga
    - **International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)** : https://dcc.icgc.org/
    - **Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIVIC)** : https://civicdb.org/welcome
    - **Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)** : https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic


See the individual resource pages for details on the download:
