A) DOWNLOADER

   Varation Call Format (VCF) Data is downloaded from the following resources
	
	sftp-cancer.sanger.ac.uk (cosmic)
	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh37/archive_1.0/2017/clinvar_20170130.vcf.gz (clinvar)

	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/downloads/nightly/nightly-ClinicalEvidenceSummaries.tsv (civic)
	Using gdc-client (tcga)



B) DATA REPORTER 

1) Checking VCF files
   Filter out variant calls if they match one of the
   following conditions:

	a) the chromosome reported is not hg37 canonical
	b) the value for the ref base is longer that one base pair
	c) the value for the alt base is longer than one base pair
	d) the value for the ref base is not in ["A","C","G","T"]
	e) the value for the alt base is not in ["A","C","G","T",",", "-","."]
	f) the value for the ref base does not match corresponding base in hg37

2) Mapping cancer terms to Disease Ontology ID 
   The various cancer terminologies used in the VCF files are 
   mapped to standard DOIDs/terms


3) Creating mutation list
   Generate a list of mutations that passed the filtering in 
   the first step. The frequency of each mutation is also 
   given in this listing using DOID for representing cancer types.

   The CSV file generated has the following fields:

	* chr - chromosome 
	* pos - genomic position
	* ref - ref base
	* alt - alt base
	* passfilter - the pass/fail filter parsed from the VCF file
	* source - one of the data sources (TCGA/ICGC/COSMIC/CIVIC/CLINVAR)
	* frequency - contains space separated DOID:count values

4) Data statistics report
   Summary statistics for all the steps performed so far. These 
   are number showing:
	- number of total VCF calls in original files
	- numer of calls filtered out
	- number of mutations by DOID
	- number of mutations by chromosome

All the steps done in this section are done separately for each 
data resource (TCGA/ICGC/COSMIC/CIVIC/CLINVAR)




C) MUTMAPPER

1) Merging mutations from various resources
   The mutation lists that have been generated for each data resource
   separately are merged in this step, and only those with "PASS" values
   in the "FILTER" field the original VCFs are considered to generate
   the master mutation inventory.

2) Checking sanity of Ensembl CDS sequences
   The Ensembl data release 75 for GRCh37 is used for annotation. Just for
   sanity checking, for each protein coding transcript, exon coordinates 
   are extracted from GTF file and used to construct CDS sequence 
   from genomic/chromosome sequences. We make sure that the constructed 
   CDS sequences are identical to corresponding CDS sequences 
   given in Ensembl release 75. 

3) Checking sanity of Ensembl peptide sequences 
   In this step, the constructed CDS sequences are translated
   into peptides, and we make sure these peptides are identical to 
   corresponding peptide sequences given in Ensembl release 75.

4) Mapping mutations to Ensembl peptides and identify
   corresponding amino acide change. 
   For those mutations that map into exon ranges, the
   genomic position of the reported mutation is mapped
   to the following:
	a) position within the CDS sequence
	b) index of the mutated codon
	c) position within the codon

   This allows identification of amino acide change
   in the corresponding Ensembl pepetide.


5) Identifying amino acide position in UniProtKB sequences

   If Ensembl peptide and UniProtKB canonical isoform
   sequences are not identical, pairwise global aligment
   is performed to identify corresponding amino acid
   position in UniProtKB canonical isoform sequences

 
6) Identifying amino acide position in RefSeq protein sequences

   If Ensembl peptide and RefSeq protein sequences are not 
   identical, pairwise global aligment is performed to identify 
   corresponding amino acid position in RefSeq protein sequences



D) ANNOTATOR

1) UniProtKB site annotations
   Position specific annotation is extracted from the UniProtKB
   resource for the following types of annotation.
	
	Active_Site_Annotation
	Binding_Site_Annotation
	Calcium_Binding_Annotation
	Cross-link_Annotation
	Disulfide_Bond_Annotation
	Glycosylation_Annotation
	Initiator_Methionine_Annotation
	Lipidation_Annotation
	Metal_Binding_Annotation
	Modified_Residue_Annotation
	Natural_Variant_Annotation
	NP_Binding_Annotation
	Nucleotide_Binding_Annotation
	Signal_Peptide_Annotation
	Site_Annotation

   The extracted site specific annotation is saved in a CSV file 
   with the following fields:

	canonical_ac - accession for the UniProtKB canonical isoform
        annotation_type - one of the site annotations listed above
	start_pos - start position of the site in the amino acid sequence
	end_pos - end position of the site in the amino acid sequence
	annotation_value - annotation given to the site


2) PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2) tool is used to predict 
   possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and 
   function of a human protein.

   For each amino acid alteration identified in the MUTMAPPER section,
   we generate the a CSV summary file from PolyPhen-2 computations. 
   The fields in this CSV file are:

	canonical_ac - accession for the UniProtKB canonical isoform
	pos - amino acid position
	ref - ref amino acid
	alt - alt amino acid
	predicted_effect - one of benign/possibly damaging/probably damaging/unknown
	probability - probability of the predicated effect 
 

3) The NetNglyc tool is used to predicts N-Glycosylation sites in human proteins 
   using artificial neural networks that examine the sequence context of Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr 
   sequons. 

   NetNglyc prediction on variant amino acid sequence is computed and the prediction
   outcome is compared to the corresponding UniProtKB Glycosylation_Annotation 
   of the wild type amino acid sequence. Base on this comparison, we generate
   the following summary outcomes on loss/gain of glycosylation

	no_change - Glycosylation_Annotation=yes, NetNglyc_prediction=yes
	no_change - Glycosylation_Annotation=no, NetNglyc_prediction=no  
	gain - Glycosylation_Annotation=no, NetNglyc_prediction=yes
	loss - Glycosylation_Annotation=yes, NetNglyc_prediction=no

   For each amino acid alteration identified in the MUTMAPPER section,
   we generate the a CSV summary file from NetNglyc computations.
   The fields in this CSV file are:

	canonical_ac - accession for the UniProtKB canonical isoform
        pos - amino acide position
        ref - ref amino acid
        alt - alt amino acid      
	uniprot_call - True/False based on UniProtKB Glycosylation_Annotation
	netnglyc_call - True/False based on NetNglyc prediction
	final_call - one of no_change/loss/gain
