1) mapsnps.pl
	Input: text file with chromosome coordinates and allele nucleotides like the following
		# Chromosome:position Reference/Variant nucleotides
		chr1:1267483 G/A 
		chr1:1158631 A/C,G,T 
		chr2:167262274 C/T 
	Output: protein substitution specifications in run pph.pl input format (input for next step)
	Example command: 
		$PPH/bin/mapsnps.pl -g hg19 -m -U -y sets/subs.pph.input sets/snps.list 1>sets/snps.features 2>sets/mapsnps.log & i
		
	(subs.pph.input is primary output we care about, snps.list is input)


2) run_pph.pl

	Input: output from step 1
	Output: file with detailed functional annotations of the SNPs (input for final step)
	Example command: 
		
	nohup $PPH/bin/run_pph.pl tmp/pph-subs.chr1.txt 1> tmp/pph-features-step2.chr1.txt 2> tmp/pph-step2.log &
 

3)run_weka.pl
	Input: output from step 2
	Output: file with predictions and scores
	Example comand: 
		$PPH/bin/run_weka.pl sets/pph.features 1>sets/pph.predictions


Map results to BioMuta table
	Step 1 - map results from Polyphen execution step 3 to BioMuta table using the following values: 
		o_acc - provided protein accession/identifier
		o_pos - provided protein position
		o_aa1 - provided wild type residue
		o_aa2 - provided mutated residue



	Step 2 - once mapping correspondence is achieved, report values in "prediction" and "pph2_prob" columns. 
	Note - scale for pph2 prob is 0 for benign to 1 for damaging.
